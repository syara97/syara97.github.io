    <p>Image of Juanfer Quintero with the Colombian soccer jersey wearing #20, when he was younger right before the 2018 World Cup in Russia. He's looking up while controlling the soccer ball with his left foot before making his next move.</p>
    <p>The best players in history are:.</p>
    <ul>
	<li>Messi</li>
        <li>Pele</li>
        <li>Maradona</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Anyhow, James is probably the best player in Colombia's history.</p>
